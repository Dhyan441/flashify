    Optical Disk: an optical disc drive (ODD) is a disk drive that uses laser light as part of the process
    of reading or writing data to or from optical discs. Some drives can only read from discs, but recent
    drives are commonly both readers and recorders, also called burners or writers. Compact discs,
    DVDs, and Blu-ray discs are common types of optical media which can be read and recorded by
    such drives. Optical drive is the generic name; drives are usually described as "CD" "DVD", or
    "Bluray", followed by "drive", "writer", etc. There are three main types of optical media: CD,
    DVD, and Blu-ray disc. CDs can store up to 700 megabytes (MB) of data and DVDs can store up
    to 8.4 GB of data. Blu-ray discs, which are the newest type of optical media, can store up to 50
    GB of data. This storage capacity is a clear advantage over the floppy disk storage media (a
    magnetic media), which only has a capacity of 1.44 MB.
